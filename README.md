This is a dictionary of English programming & software design terms for Microsoft Word. Add it to Word's proofing options and it'll get rid of red squiggly lines on words like "iterable", "backport", and "xyzzy."

Please send a pull request to add terms you've come across. Please include a reference that shows the term in use. Stackoverflow posts that show the term in conversation are great as a reference, and so are Wikipedia articles. Word's spell check lets terms that appear to be proper nouns slide, so please don't bother with trademark terms and product names.

How do I use it?

*Word 2013 (En)* - File, Options, Proofing, Custom Dictionaries, and browse to red-squiggly-braces.dic.

I'm still researching if there's an ideal place to locate red-squiggly-braces.dic such that adding it on one PC adds it on all your PCs.

*Word Web App* - Unfortunately Word custom dictionaries don't sync to the web app. When they do I'll update this. I suspect Windows 8's spellcheck is based on Office's, so perhaps there's something that can be done with that.

*Word for Mac 2011* - Word, Preferences, Spelling and Grammar, Dictionaries, Add, and browse to red-squiggly-braces.dic.

How can I add to it?

Word's .dic files are just crlf-delimited files. Add words to the file using any text editor. The Custom Dictionaries screen also allows you to add words. Finally (I don't recommend this) if in Custom Dictionaries you set the file as the default, when you use the "Add to Dictionary" option in Word it'll append to the file.
